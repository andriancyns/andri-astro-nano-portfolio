I developed a machine learning-based prediction system to estimate team win probability in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, a popular MOBA mobile game. The system utilized the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify and calculate the winning likelihood of a team based on hero composition and several critical factors such as role synergy and build strategies.

### 💻 Tech Stack
- **Tools:** MATLAB
- **Algorithms:** Naive Bayes

### 🔍 Key Objectives
- Help players understand win potential based on their team’s composition.
- Provide a decision support system for better hero selection and strategy planning.
- Highlight the importance of teamwork, hero mastery, and item builds in ranked matches.

### 🛠 What I Did
- Collected and labeled gameplay data from 30 real matches.
- Identified key loss factors: poor team composition, incorrect item builds, and lack of hero mastery.
- Applied the Naive Bayes classification algorithm to calculate win probabilities.
- Created a user interface (as a prototype) where users input team composition and receive win chance predictions.
- Modeled user flow using Use Case Diagrams to capture system requirements.

### 📊 Outcome
- Built a lightweight and educational prediction tool that served as a guide for strategic gameplay.
- Demonstrated how machine learning could enhance user decision-making in competitive games.
- The project received strong academic feedback and showcased the applicability of data science in game environments.

### 🧩 Challenges
- Limited dataset (30 matches) required thoughtful data preparation and assumption handling.
- Translating complex in-game variables into measurable and meaningful inputs for the model.

### 📁 Deliverables
- Complete dataset and preprocessing scripts.
- Functional prototype of the prediction system.
- Final report and academic presentation.
