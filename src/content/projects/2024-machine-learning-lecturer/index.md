This project is a comprehensive machine learning solution focused on building and evaluating a Random Forest-based classification system for academic staff (dosen) and administrative staff (tendik) recommendations. The solution covers the full data science pipeline, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model selection, hyperparameter optimization, and interpretability analysis.

## Key Features & Technologies
- **Data Science & Machine Learning:**
  - Utilizes Python with libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
  - Implements Random Forest classifiers for multi-class recommendation tasks.
  - Employs advanced techniques including K-Fold Cross Validation and Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning.
  - Conducts ablation studies to analyze the impact of individual features and model parameters on classification performance.
  - Visualizes decision trees for model interpretability using Graphviz.
- **Data Handling:**
  - Works with real-world datasets (`dataset_dosen.csv` and `dataset_tendik.csv`) containing dozens of features related to cognitive, social, and professional competencies.
  - Applies robust preprocessing: missing value handling, categorical-to-numeric conversion, feature scaling, and data splitting.
- **Evaluation & Results:**
  - Achieves high accuracy (up to 88%) and strong precision/recall/F1-scores, demonstrating reliable classification performance.
  - Provides detailed evaluation reports and confusion matrices for model assessment.
- **Software Engineering:**
  - Modular Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation, reproducibility, and reporting.
  - Well-structured code for easy adaptation to similar classification problems or datasets.

## Tech Stack
