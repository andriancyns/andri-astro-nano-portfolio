MAIA Suppco is a comprehensive Android application designed to streamline and digitize asset management processes for organizations, particularly in the plantation and agribusiness sector. The app enables users to manage, track, and report on physical assets efficiently, both online and offline, ensuring business continuity in areas with limited connectivity.

## Role
As the Mobile Software Engineer for this project, I was responsible for the end-to-end development of the Android application. My key contributions included designing and implementing the offline-first architecture, integrating RESTful APIs, developing user interfaces with modern Android components, ensuring robust data synchronization, and optimizing the app for performance and usability. I also collaborated closely with backend engineers and stakeholders to deliver a scalable, user-friendly asset management solution tailored to the needs of field users and enterprise operations.

## Key Features
- **Asset Management (CRUD):** Add, view, update, and delete asset records with detailed information and photo attachments.
- **Offline Mode:** Robust offline functionality allows users to operate the app without internet access. Data is stored locally and synchronized with the server when connectivity is restored.
- **Data Synchronization:** Master data and asset records can be downloaded for offline use and later synced back to the central server.
- **Photo Capture & Storage:** Capture and store asset photos locally, with automatic upload during synchronization.
- **User Management:** Register new users, manage user roles, and support multi-level access control.
- **Reporting Module:** Generate and view various asset reports, including asset lists and value control reports.
- **Search & Filter:** Powerful search and filtering options for quick asset lookup.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Intuitive interface with support for dark mode, responsive layouts, and smooth navigation.

## Technology Stack
- **Platform:** Android (Java)
- **Networking:** Retrofit, OkHttp
- **UI Components:** AndroidX, Material Design, ConstraintLayout, Shimmer
- **Image Handling:** Picasso, Compressor
- **Local Storage:** SQLite
- **Location Services:** Google Play Services Location
- **Other:** ViewBinding, Navigation Component, RxJava Adapter

## Intended Users/Organizations
- Plantation companies, agribusinesses, and enterprises requiring robust asset management solutions, especially those operating in remote or low-connectivity environments.
- Internal staff, asset managers, and field officers responsible for asset tracking and reporting.

## Notable Achievements
- Successfully implemented seamless offline/online data management.
- Enhanced operational efficiency and data accuracy for asset-heavy organizations.
