As Android developer, I was fully responsible for the redesign and feature expansion of the On Farm TMA Tebu module in the OSS Planters application. My work focused on modernizing the user interface, improving usability, and introducing new features to support efficient sugarcane plantation management.

> **Note:**  
> TMA Tebu stands for **Tebang Muat Angkut Tebu** (Sugarcane Harvest, Load, and Transport). This module is designed to manage and optimize the entire process of harvesting, loading, and transporting sugarcane within the plantation.

## 🎯 Business Context & Goals
- Part of an enterprise OSS Planters system used by plantation operators.
- Improve control and visibility over sugarcane harvesting, loading, and transport.
- Reduce errors and delays caused by legacy interfaces and fragmented workflows.

## 🧩 My Role & Responsibilities
- Owned the redesign and implementation of the module from UX to code.
- Partnered with field operators to understand edge cases and operational constraints.
- Ensured the module remained usable in low-connectivity environments.

## 📊 Impact & Outcomes
- Delivered a more intuitive TMA workflow that improved daily usability for field teams.
- Helped supervisors monitor activities and performance with better reporting tools.
- Contributed to more reliable, timely data flowing into upstream plantation systems.

## My Role & Responsibilities
- Led the complete redesign of the module, including UI/UX, architecture, and workflow improvements.
