- 🟢 **Status:** Completed (frontend MVP ready)  
- 🌐 **Live Demo:** [tokokopistaria.pages.dev](https://tokokopistaria.pages.dev/)
- 🚀 **Status:** Active development and iteration
- 📅 **Release Timeline:** Backend & payment gateway integration planned for 2025  

## 🎯 Business Context & Goals
- Help a local coffee brand move from purely offline and social-media sales to structured online orders.
- Provide a fast, modern storefront that matches the brand’s identity and supports future growth.
- Validate product-market fit for an e-commerce experience before investing in full backend build-out.

## 🧩 My Role & Responsibilities
- Acted as Product Engineer, owning UX, architecture, and implementation of the web frontend.
- Translated business requirements (menu, promotions, checkout) into flows and UI components.
- Prepared the codebase for future integration with APIs, payment gateways, and admin tools.

## 📊 Impact & Outcomes
- Delivered a production-ready frontend MVP in three weeks, ready to plug into backend services.
- Dramatically improved the structure and speed of the ordering experience versus ad-hoc chats/DM.
- Established a reusable design system and architecture that can scale into a full commerce platform.

## 📖 Problem & Solution
Staria Coffee previously relied only on offline sales and social media. The ordering process was slow, unstructured, and difficult to scale.  

**The solution I built:** a modern web-based e-commerce platform that provides:  
- An interactive product catalog  
- Fast checkout with order validation  
- Shopping cart with persistent state  

With this platform, Staria Coffee can expand into the online market, increase repeat orders, and prepare the foundation for future mobile app development.  

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18.2 + Vite  
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS  
- **UI Components:** Radix UI + custom component library  
- **Animations:** Framer Motion  
- **State Management:** React Context API  
- **Build Tools:** Vite, PostCSS, Autoprefixer  
- **Testing:** Unit, component, and integration testing  
- **Version Control:** Git workflow, ESLint, Prettier  

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development
- Leveraged **AI coding tools** to speed up boilerplate generation, UI components, and documentation.  
- Focused my time on **product architecture, UX, and feature validation** instead of repetitive coding tasks.  
- Demonstrated how AI can serve as a **productivity co-pilot** for Product Engineers.  

## 🗒️ Best Practices
- Modular component structure & reusable hooks  
- Clean code principles with linting & auto-formatting  
- Accessibility-first design  
- Performance optimization (code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization)  

## 🗒️ Key Features
- Dynamic product catalog with filtering  
- Shopping cart with local storage persistence  
- Checkout flow with validation & order confirmation  
- Brutalist-inspired design system  
- Fully responsive layouts across devices  

## 🔧 Engineering Challenges & Solutions
1. **State Persistence:** Solved with local storage sync + React Context  
2. **Performance & Animations:** Optimized rendering with React hooks  
3. **Responsive Design:** TailwindCSS breakpoints + custom components  

## 📊 Impact
- **Performance:** First Contentful Paint < 1.5s, TTI < 2s, Lighthouse Score 90+  
- **User Experience:** Checkout flow 2x faster compared to the initial prototype  
- **Scalability:** Ready for backend and payment gateway integration
