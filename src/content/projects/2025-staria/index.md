- 🟢 **Status:** Completed (frontend MVP ready)  
- 🟡 **Availability:** Demo version available on request

## 📖 Problem & Solution
Staria Coffee previously relied only on offline sales and social media. The ordering process was slow, unstructured, and difficult to scale.  

**The solution I built:** a modern web-based e-commerce platform that provides:  
- An interactive product catalog  
- Fast checkout with order validation  
- Shopping cart with persistent state  

With this platform, Staria Coffee can expand into the online market, increase repeat orders, and prepare the foundation for future mobile app development.  

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18.2 + Vite  
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS  
- **UI Components:** Radix UI + custom component library  
- **Animations:** Framer Motion  
- **State Management:** React Context API  
- **Build Tools:** Vite, PostCSS, Autoprefixer  
- **Testing:** Unit, component, and integration testing  
- **Version Control:** Git workflow, ESLint, Prettier  

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development
- Leveraged **AI coding tools** to speed up boilerplate generation, UI components, and documentation.  
- Focused my time on **product architecture, UX, and feature validation** instead of repetitive coding tasks.  
- Demonstrated how AI can serve as a **productivity co-pilot** for Product Engineers.  

## 🗒️ Best Practices
- Modular component structure & reusable hooks

## 🔧 Engineering Challenges & Solutions
1. **State Persistence:** Solved with local storage sync + React Context  
2. **Performance & Animations:** Optimized rendering with React hooks  
3. **Responsive Design:** TailwindCSS breakpoints + custom components  

## 📊 Impact
- **Performance:** First Contentful Paint < 1.5s, TTI < 2s, Lighthouse Score 90+  
- **User Experience:** Checkout flow 2x faster compared to the initial prototype  
- **Scalability:** Ready for backend and payment gateway integration
