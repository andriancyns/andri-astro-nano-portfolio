I'm a Software Engineer. My job is coding, debugging, and building systems.

This is my first post. Nothing fancy. No gimmicks. Just want to get started.

I'm creating this because I was bored.
But there's also a small intention:
I want to learn to write blogs, with the purpose of self-documentation.

I want to see how I think, develop, and maybe fail...
but keep moving forward.

In the future, the content of posts on this blog can be random: <br>
üíª Software engineer world (coding, tools, freelance, etc.) <br>
üöÄ Personal projects I'm working on <br>
üìö Things I learn (could be technical or non-technical) <br>
üéØ Career journey, experiences, insights <br>

Maybe there will be light topics too, like movies I watched, books I read, or random thoughts.

The point is, I want this blog to be a place for me to reflect and document my journey as a human and software engineer.

So... let's get started! üöÄ`

    contentEn: `## What is a Software Engineer? (My Version)

Many people think that a software engineer's job is just coding.
Open laptop, type some code, done.
But according to me, that's just the surface.

### Software Engineer = Digital Problem Solver

In my opinion, a software engineer is a **digital problem solver**.

We don't just write code. We:
- **Analyze problems** ‚Üí What exactly needs to be solved?
- **Design solutions** ‚Üí How should we solve it efficiently?
- **Build systems** ‚Üí Create applications that actually work
- **Test & debug** ‚Üí Make sure everything runs smoothly
- **Maintain** ‚Üí Keep the system running long-term

### It's Not Just About the Code

Code is just a tool. The real job is **solving problems with technology**.

For example:
- Client has trouble managing inventory ‚Üí We build an inventory management system
- Users find it hard to book appointments ‚Üí We create a booking app
- Company wants to increase sales ‚Üí We develop an e-commerce platform

### The Skills Needed

Besides coding, we also need:
- **Logical thinking** ‚Üí Breaking down complex problems
- **Communication** ‚Üí Understanding client needs, working in teams
- **Continuous learning** ‚Üí Technology keeps evolving
- **Patience** ‚Üí Debugging can take hours (or days üòÖ)

### Why I Love This Job

1. **Every day is different** ‚Üí New problems, new challenges
2. **Direct impact** ‚Üí The systems we build are actually used by people  
3. **Always learning** ‚Üí New technologies, frameworks, approaches
4. **Creative problem solving** ‚Üí There are many ways to solve one problem

That's my version of what a software engineer is.

Not just typing code, but solving real-world problems with technology. üöÄ`

    descriptionEn: "My reasons for choosing the Laravel and Flutter combination to build applications from scratch ‚Äî from speed, flexibility, to cost efficiency.",
    contentEn: `# Why I Choose Laravel + Flutter to Build Applications from Scratch?

## The Joy and Pain of Building Apps from Scratch üèóÔ∏è

Building apps from scratch isn't just about coding.
From idea, design, database, backend, frontend, to testing ‚Äî everything needs to be neat.

After years of experimenting with various tech stacks, I found my sweet spot: **Laravel + Flutter**.

Here's why this combination works perfectly for me:

## Laravel for Backend: Solid Foundation ‚ö°

### 1. **Rapid Development**
Laravel has everything I need out of the box:
- **Eloquent ORM** ‚Üí Database operations become simple
- **Artisan CLI** ‚Üí Generate components quickly  
- **Migration system** ‚Üí Database versioning made easy
- **Built-in authentication** ‚Üí Login system in minutes

Example: Creating a complete CRUD API in under 30 minutes.

\`\`\`bash
php artisan make:model Product -mcr
php artisan make:request ProductRequest
php artisan migrate
\`\`\`

Done. API ready.

### 2. **Rich Ecosystem**
Laravel has solutions for everything:
- **Laravel Sanctum** ‚Üí API authentication
- **Laravel Queue** ‚Üí Background job processing
- **Laravel Nova** ‚Üí Admin panel
- **Laravel Scout** ‚Üí Full-text search
- **Laravel Horizon** ‚Üí Queue monitoring

No need to reinvent the wheel.

### 3. **Developer Experience**
Things I love about Laravel:
- **Clear documentation** ‚Üí Everything is well explained
- **Expressive syntax** ‚Üí Code reads like English
- **Strong community** ‚Üí Lots of packages and tutorials
- **Regular updates** ‚Üí Always getting better

### 4. **Deployment Flexibility**
Laravel can be deployed anywhere:
- Shared hosting (cPanel)
- VPS (Digital Ocean, AWS)  
- Platform-as-a-Service (Heroku, Laravel Vapor)
- Serverless (Laravel Vapor)

## Flutter for Mobile: One Codebase, Multiple Platforms üì±

### 1. **Cross-Platform Efficiency**
One code, run everywhere:
- **iOS** ‚Üí Native performance  
- **Android** ‚Üí Consistent UI
- **Web** ‚Üí Bonus platform (still in development but usable)

No need to maintain separate iOS and Android teams.

### 2. **Performance Close to Native**
Flutter compiles to native ARM code:
- **60fps smooth animations**
- **Fast startup time**
- **Small app size** (with proper optimization)
- **Native platform integration**

### 3. **Rich UI Components**
Flutter makes UI development enjoyable:
- **Material Design** ‚Üí Beautiful Android-style components
- **Cupertino** ‚Üí iOS-style components  
- **Custom widgets** ‚Üí Full UI control
- **Hot reload** ‚Üí See changes instantly

### 4. **Google Backing**
Benefits of being backed by Google:
- **Regular updates** ‚Üí New features every few months
- **Long-term support** ‚Üí Not going away anytime soon
- **Great tooling** ‚Üí Flutter DevTools, VS Code extension
- **Growing ecosystem** ‚Üí More packages and plugins

## Why This Combination is Perfect üéØ

### 1. **API-First Architecture**
Laravel creates clean REST APIs:
- **Resource Controllers** ‚Üí Structured endpoints
- **API Resources** ‚Üí Consistent JSON responses  
- **Rate limiting** ‚Üí API protection
- **Versioning support** ‚Üí Future-proof APIs

Flutter consumes APIs naturally:
- **HTTP package** ‚Üí Simple API calls
- **Dio** ‚Üí Advanced HTTP client  
- **Provider/Bloc** ‚Üí State management
- **JSON serialization** ‚Üí Type-safe data handling

### 2. **Rapid Prototyping**
Want to validate an idea quickly?

**Week 1:** Laravel API + basic admin panel
**Week 2:** Flutter mobile app MVP
**Week 3:** Testing with real users

Fast time-to-market.

### 3. **Cost Efficiency**
One developer can handle both:
- **Backend:** Laravel (PHP knowledge)  
- **Mobile:** Flutter (Dart is easy to learn)
- **Database:** MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **Deployment:** Single server for API

No need for separate iOS/Android developers.

### 4. **Scalability Path**
When the app grows:
- **Backend:** Add Laravel caching, queues, load balancers
- **Mobile:** Flutter performance is already good
- **Database:** Add read replicas, optimize queries
- **Infrastructure:** Scale horizontally

## Real Project Example üìä

Recently, I built an e-commerce app with this stack:

**Backend (Laravel):**
- Product catalog management
- User authentication & authorization  
- Order processing & payment integration
- Admin dashboard with Laravel Nova
- API documentation with Swagger

**Mobile (Flutter):**
- Product browsing with search & filters
- Shopping cart & checkout flow
- User profile & order history
- Push notifications
- Offline support for favorites

**Results:**
- **Development time:** 6 weeks (solo developer)
- **Performance:** 60fps smooth, 2-3s app startup  
- **Cost:** Single server handles 1000+ concurrent users
- **Maintenance:** Easy to add features and fix bugs

## When NOT to Use This Stack ‚ùå

This combination might not be suitable for:

### 1. **Real-time Heavy Apps**
If your app needs heavy real-time features:
- **Gaming** ‚Üí Consider Unity or native development
- **Video calling** ‚Üí WebRTC might be better
- **Live streaming** ‚Üí Specialized solutions needed

### 2. **iOS-First Premium Apps**  
If targeting iOS users who expect premium native experience:
- **Native iOS** might be better for specific interactions
- **Flutter** is great but sometimes lacks the "native feel"

### 3. **Enterprise with Existing .NET/Java Stack**
If the company already has:
- **Strong .NET team** ‚Üí ASP.NET Core might be more logical
- **Java expertise** ‚Üí Spring Boot + Android native
- **Existing infrastructure** ‚Üí Better to leverage what's there

## Learning Path Recommendation üìö

Want to try this stack? Here's my suggested learning order:

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation
1. **PHP basics** ‚Üí Variables, functions, OOP
2. **Laravel fundamentals** ‚Üí Routes, controllers, models
3. **Database design** ‚Üí Relations, migrations, seeders
4. **API development** ‚Üí RESTful endpoints, authentication

### Phase 2: Mobile Development  
1. **Dart language** ‚Üí Syntax, async/await, null safety
2. **Flutter basics** ‚Üí Widgets, layouts, navigation
3. **State management** ‚Üí Provider or Bloc
4. **API integration** ‚Üí HTTP calls, JSON parsing

### Phase 3: Integration & Deployment
1. **API design patterns** ‚Üí Consistent responses, error handling
2. **Authentication flow** ‚Üí JWT tokens, secure storage
3. **Deployment** ‚Üí Server setup, CI/CD, monitoring  
4. **Performance optimization** ‚Üí Caching, lazy loading, pagination

## Conclusion üöÄ

Laravel + Flutter is my go-to combination because:

‚úÖ **Fast development** ‚Üí MVP in weeks, not months  
‚úÖ **Cost effective** ‚Üí One developer, multiple platforms  
‚úÖ **Proven stack** ‚Üí Used by thousands of successful apps  
‚úÖ **Future-proof** ‚Üí Both technologies are actively developed  
‚úÖ **Great community** ‚Üí Lots of resources and support  

It's not perfect for every use case, but for most business applications, it's an excellent choice.

**The key is choosing tools that let you focus on solving problems, not fighting with technology.**

    descriptionEn: "My experience designing scalable Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) for real projects, complete with 3 practical tips to keep your database clean and ready to grow.",
    contentEn: `# 3 Tips for Designing Scalable ERDs from Real Project Experience

## Everything Seemed Simple at First... Until Client Asked for Additions üòÖ

When I first created ERDs, I thought: "Ah, easy. Just make tables, add relationships, done."
But it turned out... two months later the client wanted new features, and my database structure immediately became a mess.

That's when I learned: **designing a database isn't just about the present, but also preparing for the future.**

After several projects (and several database rewrites ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), I found 3 tips that always save me from major headaches.

## Tip 1: Think in "Entities" Not "Features" üß©

### ‚ùå **Wrong Approach: Feature-Based Tables**

When I was still a beginner, I often created tables based on features:
- \`user_login\` table
- \`user_profile\` table  
- \`user_settings\` table
- \`user_preferences\` table

Result? **Data scattered everywhere**, hard to maintain, and full of duplicated relationships.

### ‚úÖ **Right Approach: Entity-Based Design**

Think in **business entities** that really exist:
- \`users\` ‚Üí Complete user information
- \`profiles\` ‚Üí Extended profile data
- \`settings\` ‚Üí User configuration (with proper relationships)

**Real Example from E-commerce Project:**

Instead of creating:
\`\`\`
- product_details
- product_pricing  
- product_inventory
- product_categories
\`\`\`

I create:
\`\`\`
- products (core data)
- categories (reusable)
- inventory_items (separate stock management)  
- pricing_tiers (flexible pricing)
\`\`\`

### Why This Works Better?

1. **Easier to understand** ‚Üí Each table has a clear responsibility
2. **Easier to extend** ‚Üí Adding features doesn't break existing structure
3. **More flexible** ‚Üí Relationships can be reused for different features
4. **Better performance** ‚Üí Queries become more predictable

## Tip 2: Prepare for "Soft Relationships" Early On üîó

### The Problem with Hard Relationships

I often encounter cases like this:

**Month 1:** "Users can only have one address"  
**Month 3:** "Actually, users need multiple addresses"  
**Month 6:** "We want shipping addresses to be shareable between users"

If I design with hard relationships from the start, this becomes a major rewrite.

### Solution: Flexible Relationship Design

Instead of:
\`\`\`sql
users
- id
- name  
- address
- city
- postal_code
\`\`\`

I use:
\`\`\`sql
users
- id
- name

addresses  
- id
- user_id (nullable!)
- type (shipping/billing/office)
- address_line
- city
- postal_code
- is_active

user_addresses (pivot table)
- user_id
- address_id  
- is_primary
- created_at
\`\`\`

### Benefits:

1. **Users can have multiple addresses** ‚úÖ
2. **Addresses can be shared** ‚úÖ (just remove user_id, use pivot only)
3. **Different address types** ‚úÖ
4. **Easy to add new types** ‚úÖ
5. **History tracking** ‚úÖ

**Real Case:** In one project, addresses were initially only for shipping. Later, the client wanted:
- Office addresses for companies
- Pickup point addresses  
- Gift delivery addresses

With flexible design, I just added \`type\` field. Done. No major changes needed.

## Tip 3: Use "Extension Tables" for Dynamic Data üìä

### The Challenge of Growing Requirements

Most projects start simple but keep growing:

**Initial:** "Users only need name and email"  
**Later:** "Add phone, date of birth, company, job title, emergency contact..."

If I put everything in the \`users\` table, it becomes:
- Very wide (many columns)  
- Many NULL values
- Hard to query efficiently
- Hard to add new fields

### Solution: Core + Extension Pattern

\`\`\`sql
-- Core table (stable data)
users
- id (PK)
- email (unique, required)  
- password_hash
- email_verified_at
- status
- created_at
- updated_at

-- Extension table (growing data)  
user_profiles
- id (PK)
- user_id (FK, unique)
- first_name
- last_name
- phone
- date_of_birth
- company
- job_title
- bio
- avatar_url
- preferences (JSON)
- metadata (JSON)
\`\`\`

### Why This Approach?

1. **Core table stays lean** ‚Üí Authentication queries remain fast
2. **Extensions are flexible** ‚Üí Easy to add new fields
3. **Optional data doesn't clutter** ‚Üí NULL values are isolated
4. **Different user types** ‚Üí Can have different profile extensions

**Advanced Example:**
\`\`\`sql
-- For different user types
customer_profiles
- user_id
- customer_type
- credit_limit
- payment_terms

vendor_profiles  
- user_id
- company_registration
- tax_number
- bank_account

admin_profiles
- user_id
- department
- permissions (JSON)
- last_login_ip
\`\`\`

## Bonus: JSON Fields for Ultimate Flexibility üéÅ

For truly dynamic data, I use JSON fields:

\`\`\`sql
products
- id
- name
- price
- specifications (JSON) -- Dynamic product specs
- metadata (JSON) -- Extensible data

-- Example JSON content:
specifications: {
  "color": "red",
  "size": "XL", 
  "material": "cotton",
  "care_instructions": ["machine_wash", "tumble_dry"]
}

metadata: {
  "seo_title": "Custom title",
  "tags": ["summer", "casual"], 
  "supplier_code": "SUP001",
  "internal_notes": "Popular item"
}
\`\`\`

**Note:** Use JSON wisely. Good for:
- Configuration data
- Rarely queried attributes  
- Truly flexible schemas

Avoid for:
- Data that needs complex queries
- Frequently filtered data
- Data that needs foreign key constraints

## Real Project Example: E-commerce Database üõí

Here's how I applied these 3 tips to a real e-commerce project:

### Challenge:
"We need a simple online store, just products and orders"

### My Design (with scalability in mind):

**Core Entities:**
\`\`\`sql
users (authentication)
user_profiles (personal data)  
products (catalog core)
product_variants (sizes, colors)
categories (hierarchical)
orders (transaction core)
order_items (cart details)
addresses (flexible addressing)
\`\`\`

**Extension Tables:**
\`\`\`sql  
product_specifications (JSON specs)
user_preferences (shopping behavior)
order_metadata (tracking, notes)
\`\`\`

**Flexible Relationships:**
\`\`\`sql
user_addresses (many-to-many)
product_categories (many-to-many)  
order_status_history (tracking)
\`\`\```

### Result After 1 Year:

Client additions that were **easy to implement:**
- ‚úÖ Multiple user addresses  
- ‚úÖ Product bundles
- ‚úÖ Subscription orders
- ‚úÖ B2B pricing tiers
- ‚úÖ Multi-vendor marketplace
- ‚úÖ Product reviews & ratings  
- ‚úÖ Coupon & discount system
- ‚úÖ Inventory tracking across warehouses

**Zero major database rewrites needed.** Just new tables and relationships.
